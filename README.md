AtLilyPond v.2
===============

LilyPond syntax highlighting in Atom.

### Description

This project aims at providing comprehensive and consistent syntax highlighting of [GNU LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) files in [Atom](http://atom.io).

**NOTE:** AtLilyPond is an Atom port of my [SubLilyPond](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond) highlighter for Sublime Text. For screenshots, release history, and other pertinent information check out SubLilyPond on Github.

Future versions may include a LilyPond build engine and snippets/autcompletions. Feel free to contact me for feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions.

### Reporting bugs

Please include the following with your bug reports: screenshot, LilyPond snippet manifesting the issue, short issue description, and the name of your color scheme.

### Acknowledgement

The list of keywords used in SubLilyPond was extracted from Heikki Junes's syntax definition for vim, which comes [bundled](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond-program/Vim-mode) with LilyPond.
