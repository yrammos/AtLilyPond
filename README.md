AtLilyPond
==========

LilyPond syntax highlighting in Atom.

**[INSTALLATION NOTE: AtLilyPond depends on the `language-lisp` package. Please ensure it is installed. If/when Atom provides a mechanism for declaring dependencies on other packages, this extra step will be no longer necessary.]**

AtLilyPond is an [Atom](http://atom.io) port of my [SubLilyPond](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond) package for Sublime Text (also available for TextMate [here](https://www.github.com/yrammos/tmLilyPond)). For screenshots, release history, and other pertinent information, please visit the Github page of the [parent project](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond)

For best results, you may need to try out different color schemes until you find one that adequately differentiates the various elements of your LilyPond code. As with any syntax highlighter, the potential of AtLilyPond can be fully realized only in the presence of an equally fine-grained color scheme. None of the built-in Atom schemes is particularly successful in this respect. Among other packages, I recommend `Base16 Light` and `Monokai` (but not `Atom Monokai`).

Please note that AtLilyPond is **not** a port of the standard LilyPond bundle that is distributed with TextMate. The latter, a rather old package, includes additional facilities beyond syntax highlighting (e.g. key triggers for building, snippets), but its syntax highlighter is outdated and not as refined.
