AtLilyPond
==========

LilyPond syntax highlighting in Atom.

AtLilyPond is an [Atom](http://atom.io) port of my [SubLilyPond](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond) package for Sublime Text (also available for TextMate [here](https://www.github.com/yrammos/tmLilyPond)). For screenshots, release history, and other pertinent information, please visit the Github page of the [parent project](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond).

Please note that AtLilyPond is **not** a port of the standard LilyPond bundle that comes bundled with TextMate. The latter, a rather old package, includes additional facilities beyond syntax highlighting (e.g. key triggers for building, snippets), but its syntax highlighter is outdated and not as refined as ours here.
