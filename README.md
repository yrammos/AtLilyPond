AtLilyPond
==========

LilyPond syntax highlighting in Atom.

**NOTE:** AtLilyPond is an Atom port of my [SubLilyPond](https://www.github.com/yrammos/SubLilyPond) highlighter for Sublime Text. For screenshots, release history, and other pertinent information check out SubLilyPond on Github.

### Acknowledgement

The list of keywords used in SubLilyPond was extracted from Heikki Junes's syntax definition for vim, which comes [bundled](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond-program/Vim-mode) with LilyPond.
